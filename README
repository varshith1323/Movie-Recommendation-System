Course project for the Recommender Systems course AI 705 - Spring 2024. We worked on the 1M MovieLens dataset to recommend movies to users using various methods like Collaborative Filtering, K-Means, and SVD.

## Notebooks

- `final-collaborative.ipynb` - Contains the code for User-User and Item-Item based collaborative filtering.
- `kmeans_svd.ipynb` - Contains the code for K-Means++ and Reduced SVD Implementation.
- More about the project can be found in the presentation slide deck.
